        <h1>Why i switched to linux, my linux journey</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>My first install</h2>
        <p>
            So a few years ago i wanted something new, something that would make the computer exciting again. <br>
            That's when i learned about linux, i decided that i wanted to install it right away. I asked my dad to burn the usb. <br>
            I asked for Ubuntu, but my dad laughed and said that Ubuntu is "Grandma linux". He then said i should try linux mint. <br>
            That same night i installed linux mint for the first time.
        </p>

        <h2>How i liked it</h2>
        <p>
            I then had to figure out how to play my games. Back then I only played rocket league, so one lutris install later i had it up and running. <br>
            Most of the other software i used was nativly on linux, so it was not really a hard challange.
