            <h1>Why i switched to linux, my linux journey</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>My first install</h2>
        <p>
            So a few years ago i wanted something new, something that would make the computer exciting again. <br>
            That's when i learned about linux, i decided that i wanted to install it right away. I asked my dad to burn the usb. <br>
            I asked for Ubuntu, but my dad laughed and said that Ubuntu is "Grandma linux". He then said i should try linux mint. <br>
            That same night i installed linux mint for the first time.
        </p>

        <h2>How i liked it</h2>
        <p>
            I then had to figure out how to play my games. Back then I only played rocket league, so one lutris install later i had it up and running. <br>
            Most of the other software i used was nativly on linux, so it was not really a hard challange. 
        </p>
        <h2>Switching back and forth</h2>
        <p>
            The next few months i switched back and forth between linux and windows. <br>
            But whenever i switched to windows for application support, i always missed linux.
        </p>
        <h2>Arch linux my savior</h2>
        <p>
            After switching back and forth for months i landed on Arch linux. For me it was the perfect distro. <br>
            It was the first time i didn't miss windows at all. It was also around this time i started hating windows more. <br>
            At school i had to use windows, and it genuinely bothered me. I missed the tilling from i3. That is the main reason i liked linux. <br>
            I know there is some kind of application that adds a way to tile in windows, but it doesnt work the same. <br>
            Like the way i can use a config file to edit things is something i really love. <br>
        </p>
        <h2>Linux today</h2>
        <p>
            This leads me to today. Now i am running nixos. I mean it kind of makes sense, i love the config file. <br>
            So me switching to a distro that uses a config file is not a supprise. I am still running i3wm. <br>
            I probably won't be switching away from it any time soon. I like i3, it is simple. <br>
            Also the fact that i have a config file i am happy with helps alot.
